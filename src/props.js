import React from "react";

//The following code is an example which demonstrates the concept of "props and props drilling" of React.js

// Informations and data can be passed from one component to another by drilling and those parameters which are being used for this drilling are called props and this method is called props drilling.

//Important Note about prop drilling: Information can be passed only from parent to children but information cannot be passed between to siblings(i.e., information cannot be passed between two children of a parent)

//Pasing data from app.js(parent) to children "header.js, contents.js, footer.js" by using prop drilling method can be seen.
